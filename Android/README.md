## Building the App

You need to setup some environment variables in order to build this project:

1. In your project root, create a directory called **secure**
2. Create a file in that directory called **debug_creds.properties**.
Add the following environment variables, substituting your own values:
```
    # Environment Variables  
    DITTO_APP_ID = "replace with your app id"  
    DITTO_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN = "replace with your online playground token"  
```
3. Create a file in that directory called **release_creds.properties**.
Add the following environment variables, substituting your own values:
```
    # Environment Variables  
    DITTO_APP_ID = "replace with your app id"  
    DITTO_LICENSE_TOKEN = "replace with your offline license token"  
```

* `DITTO_APP_ID` is the App ID used by Ditto; this needs to be the same on each device running the app in order for them to see each other, including across different platforms.
* `DITTO_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN` is the online playground token.
* `DITTO_LICENSE_TOKEN` is the offline-only playground token. Note this feature will be discontinued in the future.
