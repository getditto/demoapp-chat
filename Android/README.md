## Building the App

You need to setup some environment variables in order to build this project:

1. In your project root, create a directory called **secure**
2. Add a file to that directory called **creds.properties**, for the build variants as defined in the app **build.gradle** file.
Add the following environment variables to the credential file, substituting your own values:
```
    # Environment Variables  
    
    DITTO_APP_ID = "replace with your app id"
    DITTO_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN = "replace with your playground token"
    DITTO_AUTH_PASSWORD = "replace with your auth password"
    DITTO_AUTH_PROVIDER = "replace with your auth provider"
    DITTO_OFFLINE_TOKEN = "replace with your offline license token"
```

* `DITTO_APP_ID` is the App ID used by Ditto; this needs to be the same on each device running the app in order for them to see each other, including across different platforms.
* `DITTO_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN` is the online playground token. This is used when using the online playground identity type.
* `DITTO_OFFLINE_TOKEN` is the offline-only playground token. This is used when using the offline playground identity type. Note this feature will be discontinued in the future.
* `DITTO_AUTH_PROVIDER` is the authentication provider name. This is used when using the online with authentication identity type.
* `DITTO_AUTH_PASSWORD` is the authentication password. This is used when using the online with authentication identity type.
