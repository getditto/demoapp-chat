                        /* This "unreplicated/evicted" rooms section contains placeholder archived
                         rooms (stored as JSON in UserDefaults) for which messages have been evicted
                         and the room document has not been replicated by a peer.
                         
                         It is possible that a private room appearing in this section is off-mesh or
                         out of range of any peer members of the room, and therefore unable to be
                         replicated. In this case the room could be restored when in range of a peer
                         member of the room. (Note that replication will not multi-hop across
                         devices in the mesh which are not subscribed to the private room, so
                         replication will not occur until a peer member device is in range.)
                         
                         Further, if a room from this section is "restored", the placeholder room
                         instance is placed back in the privateRooms collection and will appear
                         in the rooms list (RoomsListScreen), however, the room will not contain
                         any messages until peer member replication has occurred.
                                                  
                         NOTE: The swipe-to-DELETE feature for rooms in this section is to handle
                         the case where the user creates a private room without sharing it with any
                         peer, then archives it. In this case, the room cannot be restored because
                         there are no peers with its data.
                         
                         Though possibly ambiguous to the user in the UI, without this DELETE
                         feature, there exists the possibility of an ever-increasing group of
                         orphaned private rooms without a way to remove them.

                         The DELETE operation will cause unsubscribe(), evict(), and remove()
                         on the dittoDB, however the user may be invited to join the private room
                         again by a member user/device via qrCode.
